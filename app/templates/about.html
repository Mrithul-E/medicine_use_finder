        <h1>About Medicine Use Finder</h1>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>Medicine Use Finder</strong>, your simple and reliable source for understanding medicine
            usages. In a world full of complex medical jargon, our goal is to provide clear, easy-to-understand
            information about common medicines.</p>

            understand.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Medicine Use Finder uses advanced AI technology combined with reliable online medical sources (like Tata 1mg,
            Netmeds, and more) to find and summarize the primary uses, drug classifications, and safety information for
            any medicine name or image you provide.</p>

                only</strong>. It is not a replacement for professional medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare
            professional before starting or changing any medication.</p>
